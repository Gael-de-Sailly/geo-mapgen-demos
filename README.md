# Geo Mapgen Demos
This repository contains land databases for my Minetest mod [Geo Mapgen](https://github.com/Gael-de-Sailly/geo-mapgen). This mod comes with a Python tool that converts raw elevation / land cover data into a database, that is read on map generation. However I can understand that this may be tedious for just generating one world, and it's perhaps more convenient to directly have access to the database. So I'll make here a collection of my favorite maps. If you want to add a map, please ask me on the [forum topic](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=19387) or by forum PM.

## Using the maps
- Download and install [Geo Mapgen](https://github.com/Gael-de-Sailly/geo-mapgen)
- Create a blank Minetest world and enable `geo_mapgen` mod. Don't start the game.
- Copy your desired data file from this repository to your Minetest world folder, and rename it `heightmap.dat`.
- Start the game and enjoy!
